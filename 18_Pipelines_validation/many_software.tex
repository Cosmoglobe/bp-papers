\subsection{Same Dipole}

Step zero: it must return almost exactly the input (with acceptable numerical error).
The reference signal is Dipole only.

\subsection{Different Dipole}

Step one: not so wrong.
The pipeline should be able to retrieve the correct dipole signal (can it, without galaxy?)
The reference signal is Dipole only.

\subsection{Added CMB}

Measurement of CMB effect on calibration.
The reference signal is Dipole only.

\subsection{Added Galaxy}

Measurement of Galaxy effect on calibration.
The reference signal is Dipole and Galaxy (same one as in the input).

\subsection{Added Noise}

Measurement of white noise effect on calibration.
The reference signal is Dipole and Galaxy (same one as in the input).

\subsection{Different Galaxy}

Measurement of a not completely known Galaxy effect on calibration.
The reference signal is Dipole and Galaxy (not the one in the input).
This is a realistic measurement of the error.
