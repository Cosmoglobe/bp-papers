    abstract = "{We present new measurements of the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) derived from the Lyα forest over 2.0 ≤z≤ 4.8. The small-scale structure in the forest of 61 high-resolution quasi-stellar object spectra is quantified using a new statistic, the curvature, and the conversion to temperature calibrated using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations. At each redshift, we focus on obtaining the temperature at an optimal overdensity probed by the Lyα forest, , where the temperature is nearly a one-to-one function of the curvature regardless of the slope of the temperature–density relation. The median 2σ statistical uncertainty in these measurements is 8 per cent, though there may be comparable systematic errors due to the unknown amount of Jeans smoothing in the IGM. We use our  results to infer the temperature at the mean density, T0. Even for a maximally steep temperature–density relation, T0 must increase from ∼8000 K at z≃ 4.4 to ≳12 000 K at z≃ 2.8. This increase is not consistent with the monotonic decline in T0 expected in the absence of He ii reionization. We therefore interpret the observed rise in temperature as evidence of He ii reionization beginning at z≳ 4.4. The evolution of T0 is consistent with an end to He ii reionization at z∼ 3, as suggested by opacity measurements of the He ii Lyα forest, although the redshift at which T0 peaks will depend somewhat on the evolution of the temperature–density relation. These new temperature measurements suggest that the heat input due to the reionization of He ii dominates the thermal balance of the IGM over an extended period with Δz≳ 1.}",

	abstract = {We investigate sets of random variables that can be arranged sequentially such that a given variable only depends conditionally on its immediate predecessor. For such sets, we show that the full joint probability distribution may be expressed exclusively in terms of uni- and bivariate marginals. Under the assumption that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum likelihood only exhibits correlations within a banded multipole range, ΔℓC, we apply this expression to two outstanding problems in CMB likelihood analysis. First, we derive a statistically well-defined hybrid likelihood estimator, merging two independent (e.g., low- and high-ℓ) likelihoods into a single expression that properly accounts for correlations between the two. Applying this expression to the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) likelihood, we verify that the effect of correlations on cosmological parameters in the transition region is negligible in terms of cosmological parameters for WMAP; the largest relative shift seen for any parameter is 0.06σ. However, because this may not hold for other experimental setups (e.g., for different instrumental noise properties or analysis masks), but must rather be verified on a case-by-case basis, we recommend our new hybridization scheme for future experiments for statistical self-consistency reasons. Second, we use the same expression to improve the convergence rate of the Blackwell–Rao likelihood estimator, reducing the required number of Monte Carlo samples by several orders of magnitude, and thereby extend it to high-ℓ applications.}
